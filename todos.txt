Analysis of Current Implementation vs Research Goals:

1. **Current Status**
- Using MNIST (simple digit recognition)
- Basic SAE architecture
- Three activation functions
- Basic concept emergence tracking

2. **Meets Research Goals**
✓ Compares activation functions
✓ Tracks high-frequency latents
✓ Analyzes concept emergence
✓ Studies architectural effects

3. **Missing Elements**
- More complex dataset needed
- Deeper concept analysis
- Relationship between data and learned features
- Proper attribution of high-frequency neurons

4. **Dataset Suggestions**
- CIFAR-10 (natural images)
- Fashion-MNIST (more complex patterns)
- Tiny-ImageNet (hierarchical features)
- TransformerLens activations (language features)

5. **Research Alignment**
Current implementation provides foundation but needs:
- More sophisticated feature analysis
- Better concept attribution
- Richer dataset for meaningful patterns
- Deeper investigation of activation patterns

The project fits the basic science criteria but needs enhancement to provide deeper insights into concept learning and high-frequency latent behavior.
